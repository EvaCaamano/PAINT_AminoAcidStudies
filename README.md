# PAINT_AminoAcidStudies

This is a repository led by Eva Caamaño Gutiérrez, co-Director of the Computational Biology Facility at the University of Liverpool. The simple steps outlined in the code provided set the basics of the statistical analyses of the aminoacid plasma profiles part of the PAINT (Preterm Arginine INTake) projects. These are projects led by the Neonatal Unit at the Liverpool Women's Hospital, overall directed by Professor Colin Morgan with other senior consultants driving research including Frances Callaghan and Laura Burgess. The overarching aim of these projects is to study the effect of a nutritional intervention that consists on an increased Arginine supplementation in parenteral nutrition in very preterm infants. 

## Summary of data
Three PAINT studies have been collated. PAINT and PAINT-NH3 explored the effect of a moderate intervention (12-15g/100gAA) vs control (6g/100gAA) while PAINT18 explored a higher intervention (18g/100g AA) on the same control.  Data from aminoacids at day 3 (D3) and day 10 (D10) of life have been analysed. While D10 was combined for all the studies, D3 has been explored independently in both intervention levels due to intervention start points not being comparable (with PAINT18 staring the intervention after D3 sampling and the other PAINT studies starting them earlier).

# Summary of statistical analyses
Data normality was appraised and we decided on non-parametric tests as best choice. Two sample tests were done with a Mann-Whitney test and Three group tests were done with a Kruskal-Wallis test followed by a Conover Iman post-Hoc test. All p-values were adjusted for false discovery rate via Benjamini-Hochberg correction. Plasma Arginine and parenteral arginine intake's relationship was explored with Spearman correlation. Visualisations of aminoacid concentrations were done mainly with boxplots. 

## Privacy Considerations:
This repository may not contain certain data due to its pseudonymized nature. We prioritize the protection of individual privacy and adhere to ethical standards in handling sensitive information. Pseudonymization has been employed to replace personally identifiable information with artificial identifiers, balancing the need for data sharing with privacy concerns.

## Access Requests:
If there are legitimate reasons for accessing specific data within the pseudonymized set and such requests align with ethical standards and legal compliance, we are open to considering them. Please reach out to Professor Colin Morgan's team with a detailed explanation of your request, including how the data will be used and the measures in place to protect privacy. We will evaluate each request on a case-by-case basis to ensure alignment with ethical considerations and applicable regulations.

## Ethical Data Usage:
We encourage responsible and ethical use of data. Any requests for access should demonstrate a commitment to ethical data handling practices, protecting privacy, and contributing positively to research, development, or related endeavors. By working together in a responsible manner, we aim to strike a balance between data sharing and safeguarding individual privacy.
