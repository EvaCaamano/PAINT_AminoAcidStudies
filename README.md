# PAINT_AminoAcidStudies

This is a repository led by Eva Caamaño Gutiérrez, co-Director of the Computational Biology Facility at the University of Liverpool. The simple steps outlined in the code provided set the basics of the statistical analyses of the aminoacid plasma profiles part of the PAINT (Preterm Arginine INTake) projects. These are projects led by the Neonatal Unit at the Liverpool Women's Hospital, overall directed by Professor Colin Morgan with other senior consultants driving research including Frances Callaghan and Laura Burgess. The overarching aim of these projects is to study the effect of a nutritional intervention that consists on an increased Arginine supplementation in parenteral nutrition in very preterm infants. 

## Summary of data
Three PAINT studies have been collated. PAINT and PAINT-NH3 explored the effect of a moderate intervention (12-15g/100gAA) vs control (6g/100gAA) while PAINT18 explored a higher intervention (18g/100g AA) on the same control.  Data from aminoacids at day 3 (D3) and day 10 (D10) of life have been analysed. While D10 was combined for all the studies, D3 has been explored independently in both intervention levels due to intervention start points not being comparable (with PAINT18 staring the intervention after D3 sampling and the other PAINT studies starting them earlier).


# Summary of statistical analyses
Data normality was appraised and upon non- compliant non-parametric tests were chosen. Two sample tests were done with a Mann-Whitney test and Three group tests were done with a Kruskal-Wallis test followed by a Conover Iman post-Hoc test. All p-values were adjusted for false discovery rate via Benjamini-Hochberg correction. Plasma Arginine and parenteral arginine intake's relationship was explored with Spearman correlation. Visualisations of aminoacid concentrations were done mainly with boxplots.
